Your challenge is to build an app that asks users to import a picture from their photo library, then attach a name to whatever they imported. The full collection of pictures they name should be shown in a List, and tapping an item in the list should show a detail screen with a larger version of the picture.

- Wrap UIImagePickerController so it can be used to select photos.
- Detect when a new photo is imported, and immediately ask the user to name the photo.
- Save that name and photo somewhere safe.
- Show all names and photos in a list, sorted by name.
- Create a detail screen that shows a picture full size.
- Decide on a way to save all this data.
